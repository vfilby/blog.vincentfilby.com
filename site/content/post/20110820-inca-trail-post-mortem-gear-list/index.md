The Inca Trail is a tough trek make no bones about it. It is at high
alititude, It involes a lot of stair climbing, the entire trail is mostly
cobble-stone style and it is four long days... but it is very much worth it. 

The views are spectacular and I think arriving at Machu Picchu by bus is just
being a wuss. Machu Picchu was meant to be see with sore muscles and four
days of stubble and grit.

Other people have gone into more details about the trials of the trek so I'll
refer you to them and jump right to the gear. I found the following accounts
of the trek to be helpful to me.

Quick Tips:

  * Ensure you are in good enough physical condition (you don't have to be an elite athlete but you should be capable of hiking up and downhill for 8 hours)
  * Load up your pack with all the things you plan to carry and go for a day long hike, you'll be surprised how heavy your pack can get.
  * Pack light comfortable and bring good, broken-in hiking boots
  * Hire a porter they are amazing and deserve it.
  * Most trekking companies recommend water purification tables. I'd skip them because you can buy bottled water for the first 2 days and our company boiled water for us for the last 2 days ([Peru Treks](http://www.perutreks.com/) for the win).
  * [Peru Treks](http://www.perutreks.com/)was absolutely awesome. The guides were excellent, the cooks were top notch (I ate better on the trail than in most restaurants) and it was well organized. I would highly recommend them.

Clothing

I carried the majority of my own gear since CocoPuff and I split a porter,
without the porter would have been carrying my sleeping bag as well. My goal
was to pack light, and pack comfortably. I packed a lot of hiking specific
clothes because they dry quickly and I was counting on reusing clothes as much
as possible. Here was my packing list for clothes:

  * **2 pairs of trekking pants**: you could probably just bring one, but a spare is good in case they get ripped are really dirty (say by Quinoa). My current favourite is the[MEC Mochilero Trekking pants](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/MensClothing/PantsTights/PRD~5019-926/mec-mochilero-pants-mens.jsp)
  * **2 light weight quick drying t-shits**I'd avoid cotton because it doesn't dry quickly, I have a few for working on and this [Lululemon](http://shop.lululemon.com/products/clothes-accessories/men-tops/Metal-Vent-Tech-SS-31466) is my favourite
  * **1 light weight thermal base layer **I only used these at night because I would overheat if I trekked in them, even though the mornings were quite cold they are difficult to remove on the trail.
  * **1 light weight bamboo/cotton long sleeve shirt **Great for adding a layer overtop of the t-shirts, especially in the mornings.
  * **1 set of arm warmers**I have these for cycling from [Mec](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Cycling/MensClothing/PRD~5017-578/mec-calefaction-arm-warmers-unisex.jsp), they were perfect for mornings. Even through the mornings were cold I didn't want my thermalbase layer on because it is really hard to take off on the trail, so I would add layers on top of a quick drying t-shirt that were easy to remove on the trail.
  * **1 warm jacket **I used the inner liner of my ski coat, it is very warm, light and compresses well
  * **1 broad brimmed sun hat**I have a foldable [Columbia Omni-Shade Bora Bora Booney](http://www.columbia.com/Omni-Shade%E2%84%A2-Bora-Bora%E2%84%A2-Booney/CU9745,default,pd.html) that works well and collapses nicely to stash in a pack pocket.
  * **5 pairs of socks **One for each day and an extra, you don't want to have to reuse socks. I have a nice selection of light-weight merino wool socks that worked quite well. I highly recommend [Darn Tough (made in Vermont)](http://darntough.com/ski-ride-1408.html) and [Smart Wool Phd](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/MensClothing/Socks/LightWeightSocks/PRD~5020-355/smartwool-phd-outdoor-medium-crew-socks-mens.jsp)socks. They are not cheap but man they are good. I had a single pair of cheapish ($7) hiking socks and they did not stand up to a long day on my feet, they are more suited to a couple hours of hiking.
  * **Underwear**I'd suggest one per day and possibly and extra. Beware of cotton as it doesn't dry quickly, you might end up with unwanted chaffing.
  * **1 set of flip flops or sandals for the evenings **You will be the envy of the camp, I promise you this.
  * **A plastic poncho**I opted to leave my rain shell at home and pick up a cheap plastic poncho because they are cheap, light and versatile. I didn't end up using it for rain but I did use it to when I had to set my pack down in wet grass.



Gear

  * **[Solomon hiking boots](http://www.salomon.com/us/product/quest-4d-gtx.html)**\- These are great because they don't need too much break in. Sturdy leather hiking boots are great but require more care and break in time.
  * **[Gregory Z40 Pack](http://www.gregorypacks.com/products/mens/technical/254/z-40)**\- My only other pack was much to big, it's a travel pack and is 87 litres, so I picked up this pack on sale for weekend/daytrips and it was fantastic!
  * **[Platypus hydration bag](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Packs/HydrationPacks/BottlesAccessories/PRD~5015-811/5015-811.jsp?bmLocale=en)\- **I like the camel bak style hydration systems because the keep the water weight centered on my back and they are easy to drink from
  * **Trekking Poles** \- Very useful both stability on the rocky trail and for cushioning the shock on the down hills. These saved me from falling a couple times. I would avoid sticks and go for collapsible ones so that you can stow them away when you don't need them. They don't have to be super expense, I have a cheap pair of [Humonts](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:XlsBIYr6DzsJ:english.gmarket.co.kr/challenge/neo_goods/goods.asp%3Fgoodscode%3D178556929+humont+%22msl+505%22&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca&lr=lang_en&source=www.google.ca) I picked up in South Korea for $20.
  * **Towel** \- Not a big heavy one, but a quick drying light weight pack towel is good for drying hands, face, etc
  * **Clif bars/snacks** \- I like Clif bars because they are easy to carry. [Peru Treks](http://www.perutreks.com/)far exceeded our food expectations so we didn't need to bring as much as we did. I consumed 1 or 2 per day.
  * **Hand warmers **\- Although not needed during the day, we would toss a few in our sleeping bags on the cold nights to keep warm
  * **Gloves - **I used this at nights for warmth and in the mornings, nothing fancy just light weight gloves with some warmth
  * **Twine/paracord **\- Immensely useful for lashing things to packs or other emergencies
  * **Knife** \- Infinitely useful, always carry one especially when away from the urban centers.
  * **First Aid Kit** \- Not strictly necessary as the trekking company will have this, but very useful if the guide is far away
  * **Mole skins/blister bandages** \- Necessary because blisters are a very real possibility
  * **Toilet paper and some wet wipes** \- Also necessary
  * **Pain killers** \- You may need them :)
  * **iPod** \- I barely used it, so don't bother bringing it
  * **Cameras** \- Always essential. I carry a big dSLR, but whatever camera you like is the one you should take
  * **Bug repellent/Sun screen** \- I like Ultrathon bug repellent, but anything good will work
  * **Snickers** \- Also essential :)

What I should have brought

  * Touque or warm hat for nights
  * Slightly warmer sleeping bags. I thought ours were +5C, but they are actually +15C. Not good for 0C night
  * More snickers
