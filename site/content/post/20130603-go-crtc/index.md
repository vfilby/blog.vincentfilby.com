... is one of the many things that I never thought I'd say. But, it looks
like they are trying to change the vice grip that telcos have in Canada.

"The new code will allow consumers to:

  * Terminate their wireless contracts after two years without cancellation fees, even if they have signed on for a longer term.
  * Cap extra data charges at $50 a month and international data roaming charges at $100 a month to prevent bill shock.
  * Have their cellphones unlocked after 90 days, or immediately if they paid for the device in full.
  * Return their cellphones, within 15 days and specific usage limits, if they are unhappy with their service.
  * Accept or decline changes to the key terms of a fixed-term contract (i.e., two-year), and receive a contract that is easy to read and understand."
