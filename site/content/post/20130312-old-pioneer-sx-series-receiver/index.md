I loved the old Pioneer SX vintage receivers, they were sounded great, were
built like tanks and had an actual wood case (not veneer!) Given their age a
little attention and fixing may be required from time to time, and the
schematic is helpful for such things.

Though I no longer have my SX-850 or my SX-950 hopefully this schematic will
help others.
