I have two Mac OS X computers here with my HP LaserJet 1100 printer networked
via a Windows Xp machine. The Mac's don't ship with a laserjet 1100 driver
so you have to go out and download the foomatic/hpjis drivers. These work but
they are crap! The result looks like a bad photocopy with everything bolded.
After searching awhile, I decided to try some of the other drivers for models
that I knew to be close to mine. So far HP LaserJet 6 series - GimpPrint
v5.0.0-beta works the best.

If you find a better driver or a different way to fix this problem by all
means let me know.
