Seriously, they are as unholy as the evil spawn of &lt;blink&gt; and
&lt;marquee&gt;. They were cute when they were the new kid on the block, but
now it is an annoying ritual: open page, read for 5 seconds, close popup, find
location and continue reading.

We don't care about your forum, we don't want to fill out a survey, we don't
need the best online prices for item X, and we don't need you to define
Facebook for us. What we do need is for you to get out of the way so we can
read your content.

Bottom line: Your content isn't worth navigating a mine field of affiliate
links, forum signup requests and surveys. If you want people to read your
content, ditch the popups.
