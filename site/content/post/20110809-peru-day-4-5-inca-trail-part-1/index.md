This is a photo journal of the first two days on the inca trail including day
2 -- a 5 hour up hill hike with an altitude delta of 1.2km. Here are a few
highlights, be sure to checkout the gallery below for more photos.

The first day is a hard hike but not too bad; they call it the 'training day'.
Along the way you get to see or pass through a number of inca temples or
settlements. This one is far off the pass so we could only see it from a
distance.

The second day on the trail is a brutal day. You get up and hike uphil for
5-6 hours until you get to the pass (remember that this is at a high altitude
for the sealevel dwellers). Near the top I had to take a break every few
steps; even with the pass within reach there was no energy to push forward.

Here is a stitched pano of the trail leading up from the valley to the pass.

From the pass the scenery is beautiful (when you are not shrouded in cloud),
here is a view of the Andes from the pass.

We made it!

To give you an idea how high we were, we were just below the snow line. Snow
is unusual in this pass and is mainly due to recent rainfall.

After a lengthy break at Dead Woman's Pass -- and the feeling that the hard
work is over -- we are presented with the Gringo Killer, we have to descent
600m down a rocky Inca Trail with _giant_ steps. This proved almost as
difficult as the climb to the pass. I present to you, the Gringo Killer!

One amazing and complete unexpected surprise was the night sky. Due to the
altitude and the lack of light polution you see an amazing assortment of stars
and the Milky Way is extradinairely clear. Apparently there are many solar
observatories just further south in Chile.

So far the food from Peru Treks has been amazing. I find it amusing that
despite having to carry all the tents and supplies they made room for the
chef's hats. Props to Luis for great meals.
