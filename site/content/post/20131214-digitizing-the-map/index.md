I want to preserve these maps digitally and here is the how I did it.
 
### Photography
 
I wanted to maximize detail, so each map is combined from 28-33 different images.  
 
Each sheet was photographed on a black background.  I used a speedlight on either side of the map pointing at a 45Â° angle with a white umbrella
 
 
![]( {{< localresource "layout.png" >}})
![]({{< localresource "setup.jpg" >}})
 
### Processing
 
I found in my tests that Photoshop CC did and excellent job of stitching the images together so long as I overlapped them by about half.
 
Selected single image:
![]({{< localresource "1-photo.png" >}})
 
One map combined from 33 images:
![]({{< localresource "1-tile.png" >}})
 
### The Final Product
 
Once all three maps were photographed and stitched I split them up and combined them into a single image. 
 
Compressed as a JPG the file is about 50MB and is 29665 x 27536 pixels
 
Excluding the black background the image totals approximately 600 megapixels.
 
![]({{< localresource "all-tiles.png" >}})
 
### Next Step
 
Hosting the image so that users can zoom and browse the details like google maps.
