This is a verbatim copy of my first Toastmasters speech... the ice breaker.

**Introduction**

I grew up in rural ontario. My address was Lot 17, Concession B, Camden
Township. The nearest town, Thamesville, had a population of 900 people... and
they were very proud of their traffic light.

If you wanted to see a movie you had to drive half an hour. If you wanted to
see a _current_ movie you had to drive an hour. 

The gossip section in the local _weekly_ paper was an _accurate_ record of who
visited whom during the week... and for what purpose.

Mme Toastmaster, fellow toastmasters, (and honored guests). Thamesville was
not as isolated as Timmins or Moosonee, but it is pretty far from city life.
I would like to share some of the ways that growing up rural influenced me.

**Lesson #1: Local Food**

Despite living in the country my family were not farmers; However, we had a
small piece of land that we used for land for pastures, orchards and crops.
Every year we grew enough corn for ourselves and to sell locally. And I can
assure with 100% certainty that this is made me a Seasonal Produce Aficionado.

If you have only every purchased corn from a grocery store you might not know
what corn actually tastes like. You see the moment corn is picked it starts
converting sugar to starch, and by the time it gets to the grocery store it
has already lost a large part of itas goodness. Corn picked fresh should
be so sweet and crunchy that you can eat it raw without cooking it. 

After leaving home the corn that I found in local grocery stores was a poor
imitation of what I was used to, so I stopped eating it altogether. And I
continued avoiding corn until I found a local farmer that sold fresh picked
corn. And difference was astounding. 

Now whenever I move to a new city finding a good source for local produce is
an essential task. I would encourage anyone to buy local produce, generally
the produce is fresher and you are supporting local farmers. 

**Lesson #2: Step out of the comfort zone**

While we may had some excellent seasonal ingredients, exotic cuisine was never
Thamesvilleas fort(C). We had two ethnic restaurants: Chinese and Pizza.
Everything else was sensible and consistent: meat, potatoes and vegetables.
Nothing crazy, and well within the comfort zone.

Fast forward a number of years later. I found myself in South Korea being
served a traditional Korean dinner where the majority of the courses were
strange seafoody things. Nothing sensible like meat and potatoes, and well
outside the comfort zone.

I looked hesitantly at the array in front of me... my gaze shifting from dish
to dish to the Korean host and back to the dishes. And I thought to myself,
when else will I have the opportunity to try traditional Korean food in
Korea. And who knows, I might even like them! So I tried each dish. I was
pleasantly surprised to discover that at least one of the courses... was
bearable. The others, not so much. 

It was hard for me to leave my comfort zone. I may not have like the
traditional Korean dishes, but without pushing the boundaries I wouldnat
have discovered how much I like other ethnic foods. To reinforce the point
about sensibility and comfort zone, I am proud of my mother for trying Indian
and Thai food for the first time this past year.

**Lesson #3: Animals**

Speaking of my mother, she has always had a soft-spot for animals. Growing up
I watched her take in sick animals whenever they came to our door. It was a
common routine: find a litter of sick and starving kittens, nurse them to
health and adopt them out to good homes.

She even found notoriety in the local paper when she was trying to free a
skunk who had got is head stuck in a glass jam jar on the side of the road.
The next weekas paper with a front page photo. I canat remember the
title specifically, but I like to tease her that it read aCrazy Lady Frees
Skunk.a

When I was a little older and it was my responsibility to tend our small herd
of cattle. I recall noticing a calf with an injured foot. Bandaging the foot
of a 300-400 pound calf was not small feat. But each day, I dressed the
calfas wound until it recovered.

I definitely have my motheras soft spot for animals, I couldnat imagine
not helping an animal in need.

**Conclusion**

I am very thankful for the experiences that I had growing up. Learning about
real food, hands-on experience with farm animals and many other things. Even
though I have since moved to a bigger city and pushed the boundaries of my
comfort zone... the foundation for my growth comes from my rural roots.
