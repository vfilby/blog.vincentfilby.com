Years ago during a school project I came across a surveyors map of my home town that had been marked up by historians to indicate what the buildings were used for and any _quirks_ that the owners might have exhibited.  

Such gems include:

> Mrs. Jim Vance. Wore a dust cap.  Gave out good pears at Halloween, each wrapped in paper.

And:

> Alex McDonald still owes Lloyd 75Â¢ for newspapers

All the maps were 100' to 1" scale so they span four 4' by 3' sheets. I just rediscovered my copies so I am going to attempt to preserve them photographically and post them for all to see.

So far I have one of four sheets photographed.  By taking 16 individual photos and stitching them it yields a map that is roughly about 50MP.

Here is a small teaser:
