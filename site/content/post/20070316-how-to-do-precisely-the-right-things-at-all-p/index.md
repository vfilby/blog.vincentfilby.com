If you liked Freakonomics, The Tipping Point or Blink you should probably
check out Dan Gilbert's lecture [How To Do Precisely The Right Thing At All
Possible
Times](http://server1.sxsw.com/2006/coverage/SXSW06.INT.20060311.DanielGilbert.mp3)
that was given at a [SXSW (South By South West)](http://sxsw.com) conference
in 2006. [Dan Gilbert](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm) is a
professor of Psychology at Harvard University who is an researcher in the
fields of [affective
forecasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_forecasting) and the
[fundamental attribution
error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error). [Dan
Gilbert](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm) is a compelling speaker
and talks about how humans are very poor at calculating odds and calculating
value as well as how this impacts our decision making. It is a very
interesting listen and is well worth the time.
