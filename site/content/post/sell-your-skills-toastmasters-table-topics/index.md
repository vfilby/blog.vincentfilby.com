I used this [Table Topics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_topic "Link:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_topic" ) theme (impromptu one minute
speeches) at a recent meeting and it went over really well. The idea is that
each volunteer is pretending to have a skill set and they are trying to sell
that skill set for a completely unrelated job. Some examples that I used
were:

  * You are a gourmet chef interviewing for a pet food tasting position
  * You are a cowboy interviewing for a make-up consultant

You have some latitude to work with this theme, you can make it more serious
or more playful depending on the meeting. You can download the full script
and topics .pdf below.
