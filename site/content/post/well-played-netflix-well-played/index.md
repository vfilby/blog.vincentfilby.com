Netflix now creating their own content:<http://blog.netflix.com/2011/03

Netflix is awesome, there is no question about it. $10 (ish) dollars per
month and you can stream what you want, when you want. The biggest draw back
is content availability (especially in Canada), so this is exciting news. I
would love to see more original or recent and popular content on Netflix.
