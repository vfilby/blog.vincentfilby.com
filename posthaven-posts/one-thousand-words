<p>My second Toastmasters speech for the project "Organize Your Speech."  This is written for speaking, not for reading so take it as such.  There is also an accompanying slideshow of images, if you are interested in seeing the full presentation contact me on twitter @vfilby.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Introduction</b><br></p>
<p>Take a moment and try to remember a photograph that has made a lasting impression on you.  (3s pause)</p>
<p>Now ask yourself why, why did it make a lasting impression.  Chances are good that you felt an emotional connection, that the photo “told a story” to you.  I have seen and forgotten thousands of very pretty pictures, but the photos that tell me a story have always stuck with me.  </p>
<p>Mr Toastmaster, fellow toastmasters, and honored guests.</p>
<p>As a photographer, the most powerful thing you can do is to create a photograph that tells a story.  Today I would like to share three lessons that I have learned to help tell a story with a photograph.</p>
<p><b>#1 Get Real</b></p>
<p>The famed street photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson said that everything has a decisive moment. And if you miss that moment it is gone forever.</p>
<p>This decisive moment is the moment that tells the story.   That moment lives in the real world... it does not live in the studio and it most certainly does not pose in pictures for a slice of fine cheddar.   </p>
<p>To make it real I avoid posed photos and I shoot candidly.  When you ask someone to pose for a photo 9 times out of 10 you will get that fake, perfunctory smile that I would normally expect from an airline.  </p>
<p>When you catch them unaware of the camera you will see the real expression and that moment unfolding.</p>
<p>That is lesson #1: Focus on the moment and shoot candidly.</p>
<p>Now unless the story your are trying to capture, is “someone yelling at you” I wouldn’t walk up to a stranger and try this.</p>
<p>Getting real is not enough.  You need to get to know a person before you can begin to tell their story.  and that brings us to ....</p>
<p><b>#2 Get Engaged</b></p>
<p>Genuine expression and emotion is the cornerstone of a great photo.  The only way to get genuine is to build a relationship with the person</p>
<p>Engage people and strive to understand them.  Only once you  build a relationship with a person will they let their guard down and let the genuine shine through.  This takes a lot more time that stealthy snapping photos from the shadows but it is more rewarding.  And you won’t have angry people chasing you.</p>
<p>This same idea applies to places as well.  I need to explore a place before I can understand it.  Often my favourite photos are taken from hidden nooks and crannies, from well off the beaten path, or from places where tourists don’t go.  </p>
<p>Engaging places and people is essential to understanding them.  And Understanding them is essential to telling their story.  </p>
<p>That is lesson #2.  Getting Real and getting engaged are incredibly important, but I am going to entreat you to go what step further.</p>
<p><b>#3 Get Your Hands Dirty</b></p>
<p>I have laid in the mud ... withstood the bitter cold ... and even tested my wife’s patience making her wait while I took pictures of a “stupid” tree.  I have learned: never be afraid to get involved.</p>
<p>When I take pictures as a bystander... the photos feel like they are a bystander.  But when I am in the middle of the action... the photos feel like they are in the middle of the action.   Getting involved will help you tell the story.</p>
<p>As a general rule, never be afraid to get closer.   Getting closer shows so much more detail!  Detail is candy for the imagination, and detail will help your story unfold. </p>
<p>Let’s do an experiment  </p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>These are the three lessons I have learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>I get real by avoiding posed photos and focussing on the moment as it unfolds</li>
<li>I get engaged: by talking to people, trying to understand them, and by exploring places</li>
<li>I get my hands dirty by getting up close and getting in the middle of the action</li>
</ol><p>If you practice assiduously, anyone can take photographs that tell a story and live up to the old adage that a picture is worth 1000 words.</p>
