Recipe

  * 1c Popcorn
  * 1/3c Corn oil
  * 1/2c Sugar

Instructions:

  1. Add protective gear. I'd recommend long sleeves, rubber gloves and a safety glasses (perhaps a face shield if you have one). Seriously you will have exploding kernels, hot oil splatters and more -- it's like a reenactment of Normandy but with scalding oil.
  2. Mix corn and oil in a big pot, I mean big... like a giant stock pot.
  3. Once oil starts to boil add sugar and stir constantly or else the sugar and popcorn will burn.
  4. Once popped put popcorn in a bowl, add salt and mix well.
  5. Eat kettle corn
  6. See a therapist about your chemical addiction to kettle corn.
