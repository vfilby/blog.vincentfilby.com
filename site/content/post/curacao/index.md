On a recent trip to Curaao I tried my hand at underwater photography and
video with a GoPro Hero3 Black. See the video and stills gallery below for
visuals.

  

The GoPro is an awesome, relatively cheap platform to take underwater; but the
Hero3 Black has some serious issues. I had to pull the battery out 60-100
times to hard reset the camera over the course of a week. And the battery
life is about 1-2 hours for video.

  

What I learned about photography underwater with a GoPro:

  * A red filter helps colour correct once you get deep enough, but closer to the surface it is pointless. If you a snorkelling don't bother, especially if you are near the shore because the slope of the sea floor will show redder as it nears the surface. But if you are SCUBA diving then it is a must unless you are striving for greenish things.
  * I need to be a better SCUBA diver and have better motor control so you can get close and stay steady.
  * I am far tobuoyant in salt water to free-dive and take photos. While I could dive down I couldn't stay down and steady to take a photo, I just popped back up to the surface.
  * When using a POV camera like a GoPro spend a bit of time with the camera so you know it's focal ranges and angle of view. With the GoPro you need to see it in your mind in order to make it work. I found for close ups you generally want to be about a foot from the subject. Closer and you lose focus, further and it doesn't fill the frame the way I wanted.
  * Don't be afraid to let the camera go. I weighted the camera and propped it in the sand and backed away to let the fish explore it on there own.

I am very much looking to going down again and I would love to try a camera
that gives me a bit more creative control.
