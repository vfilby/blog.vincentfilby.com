I completed my first century ride. On September 21, 2005 I biked 220.6 km from
Guelph to Thamesville. Being my luck or some unearthly hazing ritual, a
thunderstorm was up and coming so I had to fight a stiff headwind all the way
to London, adding a couple extra hours onto the total trip time. In London the
thunderstorm hit and I was forced to shelter in a coffee shop for 5 hours
while the severe part of the storm passed; I didn't want to continue in the
middle of a lightening storm. Once it had passed I rode the second half of the
trip in the rain and in the dark. It was a rough ride and although I had a
sore ass the next day, it was a great experience.
