Perhaps the the most exciting part of the journey is when you reach the Sun
Gate and just sit there looking out over Machu Picchu as the morning passes. 
This is by far the highlight. Sadly it almost devalues the experience of the
ruins themselves. After hiking for four days through the Andes and
witnessing Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate, walking through the ruins doesn't
seem as exciting. You walk around for a few hours, look at big rocks and
then head out in search of chairs, showers and beds. 

The bus down to Aguas Calientes was the first chushioned chair in 4 days. It
was glorious.

The morning hike was ungodly early and wet, perhaps worth it because of the
rainbow over Machu Picchu as seen from the Sun Gate.

It was still quite misty so I had to toy with this image to get even a hint of
Machu Picchu to show... I swear it is down there!

This rock was carved by the Inca's to match the profile of Machu Picchu (the
mountain, not the city).

Around Machu Picchu there are signs indicated which route you are on (long,
medium, short). Apparently in this case the long way involved scaling a few
walls.

Now time to head back to town for beer and pizza.
