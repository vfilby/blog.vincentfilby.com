The last day of the trip involved an 8 hour layover in Lima, then on to home.
To make the best of the layover we decided to stroll around Miraflores and
have dinner by the ocean... not really thinking at the time that one of us
doesn't care for fish and the other is vegetarian.

Last morning in Cuzco. Breakfast at Jack's Cafe then off to the airport. 
This pizza/hamburger truck was stationed near our hotel the entire time.
