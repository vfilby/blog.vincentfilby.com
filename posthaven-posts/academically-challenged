<div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vfilby/791808809/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1202/791808809_3f9ca957a3_m.jpg" height="180" alt="Old Johnson Hall Entrance" width="240"></a></div>
<p>After I graduated I did a foolish, foolish thing.  I chose to <em>start</em> a Masters degree in Computer science.  Note the emphasis on <em>start</em>. I can hear the virtual masses mocking me; of course by masses I mean all five of you. But wait! I have an excuse!  I graduated just after the .com crash, seeing dismal job prospects I decided to stick around for some higher education. I had other delusions at the time: "a masters degree will help with my career!"  Now I am sure that two extra years would have bolstered my career as a programmer much more than a masters.  But really, who doesn't want to be the master of something. <em>And</em> have the paper to prove it!  I started as a young graduate full of enthusiasm, imagining the how great my research <em>could</em> be.  The doors that it <em>could</em> open and even potentially a career as a professor! Don't fret friends, the delusion was temporary.  Time wore on and my enthusiasm dwindled, my straight and narrow path to glory begin to meander leaving the <em>potential greatness</em> scattered in my wake.   Then I committed the ultimate academic mistake - fatal to my academic career yet with a net positive effect - I defected. I started to work in the industry.</p>

<p>Two years later I am realizing that my leave of absence is about to end and that it is time to get my ass in gear and finish what I started.  I am also realizing that I haven't really even looked at my work in the past two years, so getting back into the swing of things is painful.  That coupled with the seemingly magnetic repulsion that I have developed towards my thesis make it exceptionally hard to work on.  Here I am editing and reflecting on my academic past.  I have definitely learned a few lessons:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://www.phdcomics.com">Ph.D. Comics</a> is the closest and most realistic portrayal of grad life.  Any future grad student should read <em>every single comic strip</em> to understand what they are in for.  You can swear that you will be different than Slackenery, but better individuals have been wrong.</li>
<li>The rate at which your research becomes obsolete is slightly faster than the rate at which you can research. This is even more pronounced for my own rate of research! </li>
<li>Free food only comes second to free money.</li>
<li>Graduate student labs rarely have windows.</li>
<li>Campus life - you know, everything but the researchy-working stuff you are <em>supposed</em> to be doing - is absolutely awesome.  I miss being on campus.  Especially chillin' with a friend in the middle of Johnson Green eating frosties and listening to Aerosmith.  The fact that we were illegally parked on campus in a place where there really isn't a parking spot only makes the memories sweeter.</li>
<li>
<em>(Added July 17, 2007)</em> It is beyond annoying when <a href="annoyance-potential">people continually harass you about your thesis</a>.</li>
<li>Lastly, try to keep all of your referenced papers in pdf form, indexed and searchable from your computer.  Trying to find a bit of information from a single paper can be a bitch when you have to delve through a stack!</li>
</ol><p>Time to get back to work, I really gotta get this monkey off my back.</p>
