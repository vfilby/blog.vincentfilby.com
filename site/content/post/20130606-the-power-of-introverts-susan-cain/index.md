I have always found myself on the outside in business, it's a world dominated
by the back-slapping extroverts. I have sought out ways to either fit in or
to use my nature to my advantage and I wish this had been written sooner!

Susan Cain gives a lot of insight to the plight of the introverted types and
backs it up with some concrete data. If you want to understand why you do
the things you do, how to use it to your advantage then you should watch the
video below. If you are an extrovert and want to understand the quiet types
a bit better you should watch it to.

If you liked what you saw there, then you should really go get the book and
give it a read. It does not disappoint: [Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a
World That Can't Stop
