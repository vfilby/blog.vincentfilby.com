Bubble](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vfilby/318898832/), originally uploaded

Taken about 1:30am just after security kicked me out of the park. The South
Michigan ave hotels and shops reflected perfectly in the sculpture over the
cloud gate, making it appear as it all the buildings were in a soap bubble..
