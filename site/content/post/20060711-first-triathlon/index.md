My company, TrueLocal, sponsored a triathlon this past weekend and encouraged employees to participate (by means of a free trip to Mexico!). I have never been a super fast cyclist but I have done distance so I decided to enter. I am not a small guy and I have never raced previously so I was happy with my average (27.2km/h).

I had a great time and I will definitely participate in more relay triathlons in the future. I think I may splurge on clipless pedals and a set of tri-bars first, though, in a shameless attempt to better my speed with gadgets.
