It is a Saturday, in the industrial area outside of Guelph and I am the only one at work. It had been raining on and off but the big she storm came suddenly. Being the sort who finds the chaos and havoc of a good thunder storm oddly calming, I wandered out the back entrance out the back door and into the glassed in foyer area where I could watch the rain coming down for a little while.

I calmly and surely walked right out the back door and enjoyed five peaceful minutes of storm watching. Relaxed I decided it was time to get back to the grind and I reached for the door. That nagging sinking feeling that accompanies slow realization tickled my stomach, then as the door stood fast against my pulling full realization dawned upon me.

Weekends... Automatic locks...

All my keys, access card, coat, phone and everything but the clothes on my back inside the building behind a securely locked door.

I ran to my car, opened the unlocked door and hopped in but... no keys! I was already soaked just from the 15 foot dash so I just sat there racking my brain for possible plans. I ransacked the inside of the vehicle looking for something, anything to help me out of my bind. No coat, no spare keys, no phone, no mystical door opening gnome. I did, however, found some duck tape, a pair of pliers and a small screw drivers. None of which could be considered helpful unless I was to channel McGyver.

Remember it is a Saturday on the outskirts of Guelph there is nothing in the area, I doubt I could even find a payphone. Even if I could find one I don't know the phone numbers of the people who could let me in... I was feeling right and proper fucked. So I just stayed there for a few minutes watching the rain pouring down debating on which road I should trod on to find assistance. I reckoned it would be a fifteen minute walk to find someplace that may have an active staff member and a phone. If fifteen feet left me drenched, I was certainly not looking forward to a fifteen minute hike through industrial Guelph.

It was better than nothing.

Then I remembered that there is a phone in the font entrance that I have access to! Maybe I can use it to call some people, who might know the numbers of some other people and they in turn might be able to figure out who to call to let me back in.

Considering the embarrassing chain of phone calls and story telling I was about to undertake, I hastily debated on whether it would be better to scrounge the construction area for a bit of stiff wire that I could use to pick the lock and begin a life of crime.

Thinking about that phone, I took a chance on running around the building. Remember this is a big ass warehouse and it is seriously raining outside. I ran around quickly trying every door I could find until I got to the front foyer. I approached the phone wondering if this thing could even make a local call.

I looked over at the phone, fearfully anticipating the embarrassing conversations and the journey of humility that I was about to embark on, when I glanced over at the front door once again considering the life of crime.

The mostly closed yet slightly ajar door.
