            <p><em>**Warning: **If you are considering grad school you may not want to base your
decision solely on this post&hellip; tempting as it is.</em></p>

<p>After I graduated I did a foolish, foolish thing. I chose to <em>start</em> a Masters
degree in Computer science. Note the emphasis on <em>start</em>. I can hear the
virtual masses mocking me; of course by masses I mean all five of you. But
wait! I have an excuse! I graduated just after the .com crash, seeing dismal
job prospects I decided to stick around for some higher education. I had other
delusions at the time: &ldquo;a masters degree will help with my career!&rdquo; Now I am
sure that two extra years would have bolstered my career as a programmer much
more than a masters. But really, who doesn&rsquo;t want to be the master of
something. <em>And</em> have the paper to prove it! I started as a young graduate
full of enthusiasm, imagining the how great my research <em>could</em> be. The doors
that it <em>could</em> open and even potentially a career as a professor! Don&rsquo;t fret
friends, the delusion was temporary. Time wore on and my enthusiasm dwindled,
my straight and narrow path to glory begin to meander leaving the <em>potential
greatness</em> scattered in my wake. Then I committed the ultimate academic
mistake - fatal to my academic career yet with a net positive effect - I
defected. I started to work in the industry.</p>

<p>Two years later I am realizing that my leave of absence is about to end and
that it is time to get my ass in gear and finish what I started. I am also
realizing that I haven&rsquo;t really even looked at my work in the past two years,
so getting back into the swing of things is painful. That coupled with the
seemingly magnetic repulsion that I have developed towards my thesis make it
exceptionally hard to work on. Here I am editing and reflecting on my academic
past. I have definitely learned a few lessons:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.phdcomics.com">Ph.D. Comics</a> is the closest and most realistic portrayal of grad life. Any future grad student should read <em>every single comic strip</em> to understand what they are in for. You can swear that you will be different than Slackenery, but better individuals have been wrong.</li>
<li>The rate at which your research becomes obsolete is slightly faster than the rate at which you can research. This is even more pronounced for my own rate of research!</li>
<li>Free food only comes second to free money.</li>
<li>Graduate student labs rarely have windows.</li>
<li>Campus life - you know, everything but the researchy-working stuff you are <em>supposed</em> to be doing - is absolutely awesome. I miss being on campus. Especially chillin&rsquo; with a friend in the middle of Johnson Green eating frosties and listening to Aerosmith. The fact that we were illegally parked on campus in a place where there really isn&rsquo;t a parking spot only makes the memories sweeter.</li>
<li><em>(Added July 17, 2007)</em> It is beyond annoying when <a href="annoyance-potential">people continually harass you about your thesis</a>.</li>
<li>Lastly, try to keep all of your referenced papers in pdf form, indexed and searchable from your computer. Trying to find a bit of information from a single paper can be a bitch when you have to delve through a stack!</li>
</ol>

<p>Time to get back to work, I really gotta get this monkey off my back.</p>
