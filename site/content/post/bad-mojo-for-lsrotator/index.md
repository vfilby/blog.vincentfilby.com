My iPhone has become an extension of my car audio system. It is my music
repository and my navigation system as well as a bunch of other odd jobs. 
The only real annoyance was that album art isn't rotated properly in landscape
mode... and in my car my iphone is permanently in landscape mode.

LSRotator to the rescue... or not. Let's just say it is the Aquaman of
iPhone tweaks.

It crashes... frequently. things like album art are not centered properly
and are at least partially off the screen. I can't even add screen shots
because it won't stay in an un-crashed state long enough.

Perhaps I am an oddity by my phone isn't heavily tweaked and it was so
unstable I removed it after 30 minutes. I'd say purchase at your own peril.

[For the geeks, it's an iPhone 4 running 4.2]
