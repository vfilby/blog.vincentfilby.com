In an elevator I recently over heard someone talking about a "nitch market."
The word niche comes from French and should be pronounced _neesh_.

When you order Quiche Lorraine, do you say "Quitch Lorraine," or are
microfiche "microfitch.". No is the correct answer, it is not 'itch', it is
'eesh'. So in the future look smart and worldly, and say 'neesh.'
