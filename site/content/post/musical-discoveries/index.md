**Datarock - Fa Fa Fa**

**Said the Whale - Camilo (the Magician)**

{{< youtube Ar0bmGshhTs >}}

(thanks Mike!)



**Jimmy Swift Band - 80's Runway Model**

{{< youtube 94Gyx9GDTKQ >}}

Absolutely fantastic programming background music.



**Dan Mangan - Some people**

{{< youtube 0_vJWgkmt-o >}}

Excellent Canadian folksy singer songwriter. Also check out Sold



Some old classics that I think are still worth checking out:

**DeVotchKa - The Enemy Guns**

{{< youtube lut81f4iI0w >}}

These guys put on a fabulous concert and they are entirely not what you'd
expect, if you ever chance to see them live do it. Also check out Venus in
Furs, Curse Your Little Heart, Death by Blonde and Such a Lovely Thing.



**United Steel Workers of Montreal - Small Town Banks**

{{< youtube LQK4o7Iaorc >}}

Another excellent Canadian band that puts on an excellent show full of crazy
stories, double bass shenanigans and a conspiciously absent beer bottle
throwing competition. Be sure to checkout Tracie Dean and Meaner Than You.
