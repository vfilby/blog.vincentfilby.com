In [this excellent talk by Michael Jurewitz](http://jury.me/blog/2013/4/2
/thriving-in-an-app-store-world) he talks about surviving in the app store
world. The first 30 minutes are dedicated to what apple developers should do
to be good apple citizens. The second half talks about pricing your app and
about avoiding the low-cost, high-quantity problem that is plaguing the app
store now.
