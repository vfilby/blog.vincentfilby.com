I love the idea of one universal login but whenever I see Facebook Connect I
am uneasy about the amount of permissions many websites _require._I don't
even try to use Facebook Connect anymore, I just create another username/pass
so I have more control over my privacy. It's not facebooks fault really,
just web developers that ask for too much.

Unless your site integrates with my facebook in a useful way to me there is no
way I am going to give you access to post on my wall, see my networks, list of
friends, likes, etc.

What really scares me is that most people probably just click 'Ok'.
