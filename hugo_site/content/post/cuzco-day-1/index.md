Today is the first day of our Andean adventure, the ultimate goal is to have a
springy good time while trekking the 45km from near Ollantaytambo to Machu
Picchu on the Inca Trail. The first three days will be in Cuzco to
acclimatize to the elevation then four days of hiking through the Andes.

Today was almost entirely consumed by travelling but there are some definite
highlights.

  1. Going from sea-level to3,326 m (10,912 ft)in a single day is bound to kick your ass, acetozolamide or not. At altitude without any time to acclimatize, walking up a flight of stairs feels like sprinting 4 flights of stairs at sea level.
  2. Salkantay fly-by. As you fly into Cuzco if you look out the left side of the plane you see the Salkantay peak at the same elevation of the plane, wicked cool. Very sad that I was on the right side of the plane.
  3. iPeru travel assistance. The Cuzco airport is full or tour companies that have large 'tourist information' signs, avoid them all and look for iPeru just before the exit, they are very helpful and you won't have to buy something from them.
  4. Dur to a terminal change at JFK and a flight cancellation at Lima we had to clear airport security 4 separate times.

One really strange thing about acetozolamide (the meds that help you
acclimatize quicker) is that it halts the process that converts carbon dioxide
to carbonic acid. All fizzy drinks now taste flat and sweet. Pop tastes
gross as well as beer. However if you let the beer (or pop) sit on your
tongue for 2-5s the process will start to work well enough so that you can
taste what you are drinking.
