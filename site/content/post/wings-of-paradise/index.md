[Wings of Paradise](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vfilby/103768562/),

This is the first official installment of my photoblog, I will usually post
the photos Sunday afternoon or Monday morning.

This photo was taken at the [Wings of
Paradise](http://www.wingsofparadise.com/) butterfly conservatory near Guelph,
ON. This is probably my favourite nature photo that I have taken. I love the
colours of the butterfly and the leaves, and the curves of the leaves really
give the photo a smooth, sensual touch.
