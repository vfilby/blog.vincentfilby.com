Awesome surprise trip to Jay Peak. Three days of boarding, more than 20" of
fresh powder, and awesome glades.

Thanks for the good times Jay, I suspect I'll come back next year.

Pros:

  * Powder.
  * Glades... glades and more glades. I spent the majority of my time in the glades. And they have glades that are accessibile to all levels.
  * Tram Haus lodge is at the base of the lifts and has good food.
  * They have their own beer (Tram Haus Ale)

Cons:

  * Jay was very windy while we were there, the west side runs were wind swept and very icy.
  * You need a balaclava on the open lifts... they are long and windy.
  * Visibility can really suck at times.

Break down of the runs I remember:

  * Goat Run: Very icy and wind swept, really only used it to get access to other runs
  * Valhala: A little too difficult for me.
  * Moon glades: So much fun, probably spent about 60% of my time in these trees.
  * Ullr's Dream: Super slow, avoid the bottom it unless you like walking or poling
  * Kokomo: More nice glades
  * Bushwhacker: Little bit harder than the moon glades but super fun
  * Beaver pond glades: Harder than bushwhacker but super fun
  * Northway: Meh, it's a taxi run... flat and narrow...
  * Vermonter: Nice in the powder
  * Angel's Wiggle: decent blue
  * Milk Run: Another decent blue
  * JFK: Fairly easy for a black run... closer to a dark blue run.
  * Wedelmaster: Access to the beaver pond glades... very important.. can be windy
  * Derrick Hot Shot: Nice easy black run

My recomendation: Find a glade that is suited to your skill level. Start at
the moon glades, then to bushwhacker, then to beaver pond and if you are
really daring go for Valhala.
