When I converted filbar.org to Drupal I kept the same styling by creating a custom theme. That theme never did get much attention and was always alittle rag-tag. So I recently decided to update filbar.org with a brand new shiny theme.

Before

![]({{< localresource "filbar-classic.png" >}})

After

![]({{< localresource "filbar-modern.png" >}})

I will likely continue to tweak the theme as I find things that need it, maybe even add 'mission' box to the front page to give it some uniqueness.
