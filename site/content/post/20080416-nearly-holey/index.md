I like to introduce this story to my friends with the phrase, "I was almost shot!" This usually gets their attention. I'll admit that it is almost a false pretense. Looks like you'll have to read on.

I was in Seattle with my friends [Chris](http://www.chrass.com/) and Capi, we decided a pub crawl was the best way to cap off a round of interviews. A crawl that ended in the supposedly less-than-savoury neighbourhood of Beacon Hill at [The Beacon](http://www.restaurantica.com/restaurants/389453/).

The story doesn't end here, I did say 'almost shot.'

We left alive, unperforated and very much unaware of the craziness that was about to ensue. The next morning brought frantic phone calls querying as to our life/death status, holeyness, general well being and store of local gossip. You see, there was a [shooting in our neighbourhood](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004330023_webtripleshooting06m.html) and as it turns out, it was at [The Beacon](http://www.restaurantica.com/restaurants/389453/). Less than ten minutes, ten minutes, after we left, some dude opened fire in the bar. He was sitting at the bar not too far from us, some of our party were talking to him while at the bar.

Three people shot, two critical but stable. Word on the street is that he was waiting for an ex or estranged girlfriend. All this happened less than ten minutes after we vacated the bar.

A bunch of savages in this town I tell ya!
